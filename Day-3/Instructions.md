# Day 3
Create a function that takes in an argument and prints the argument to the screen on click of a button

## Detailed explanation
- In the `Day-3/` directory, create `index.html`, create `index.js`
- In the JS file, create a function that takes in a parameter
- In the HTML file, create a button that calls the function `onclick`, and pass an argument of string to the function.
- Whatever is passed into the function from the onclick call on the button should be printed to screen.
- The argument that should be passed to the function is `Welcome To 40 Days Of Code`.

## HINTS: 
- Use `document.write()` or `console.log()` to print to the page
- Do your print inside your function
